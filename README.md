# Titanic
My take on Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. The Titanic Dataset is one of the most famous datasets in Kaggle and this is my attempt at solving it. The entire analysis is based on simple derivations without the use of any visualizations. No graphs, no plots, just good old descriptive analysis. The submission scored 76.55 in Kaggle.
